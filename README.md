# The DNA methylation signature of aging and neurodegeneration in human brain frontal cortex
We constructed the first large-scale brain methylation atlas for the East Asian population, comprising over 1,000 PFC samples, addressing a critical gap in human brain epigenetic data in EAS. Our study elucidates the landscape of age-related methylation sites in the PFC, with more than one-third of CpG sites showing significant age-associated methylation changes. We identified 485 ADNC-associated CpG sites including 228 novel sites and characterized their potential functional roles. Through integrative analysis of age, methylation, and ADNC, we delineated the age-dependent dynamics of ADNC-associated methylation sites and quantified the proportion of age-ADNC associations mediated by methylation. These findings provide valuable insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying brain aging and ADNC in East Asian populations.
